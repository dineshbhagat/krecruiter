# TODOs

- create branches:
    - master (complete solution) 
    - 1-mock-based-unit-tests
    - 2-integration-tests
    - 3-kotlintest
    - -> document in README
- Feedback Slide + Feedback QR Code 
- idea: insert some mistakes in the production code. attendees should find errors by writing tests.
- pass info to attendees.
- slides 
    - integration test slides: migrate code examples to kotlin
- more tests?:
    - check out java testing guide: what else can we test that require special assertions.
    - add a Scheduler - maybe it will email
    - more complexity required? rename applicant to person and introduce recruiter and hiringManager as parts of the application
    
# low prio

- use term "component test" instead of "integration test"? at least name it once in the slides.
- use flyway instead of DIY-schema creation
