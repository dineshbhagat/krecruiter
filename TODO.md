# TODOs

        - create slides for talk (and apply changes)
        - use reuse Testcontainers instead of docker-compose: https://bsideup.github.io/posts/local_development_with_testcontainers/
        - reuse with testcontainers? document (.testcontainers.properties). remove debug output.
        - create branches:
        - master (complete solution)
        - 1-mock-based-unit-tests
        - 2-integration-tests
        - 3-kotlintest
        - -> document in README
        - pass info to attendees.
        - more tests?:
        - check out java testing guide: what else can we test that require special assertions.
    - add a Scheduler - maybe it will email

# low prio

- idea: insert some mistakes in the production code. attendees should find errors by writing tests.
- use term "component test" instead of "integration test"? at least name it once in the slides.
