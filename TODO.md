# TODOs

- create branches:
    - master (complete solution)
    - 1-mock-based-unit-tests
    - 2-integration-tests
    - 3-kotest
    - -> document in README
- pass info to attendees.
- more tests?:
    - check out java testing guide: what else can we test that require special assertions.
    - add a Scheduler - maybe it will email

# low prio

- idea: insert some mistakes in the production code. attendees should find errors by writing tests.
- use term "component test" instead of "integration test"? at least name it once in the slides.
