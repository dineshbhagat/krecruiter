# TODOs

- kotlinTest
- testing coroutines?
- move solutions to different branch. remove them from master branch.
- idea: insert some mistakes in the production code. attendees should find errors by writing tests.
- pass info to attendees. make github repo public.
- create slides 
    - integration test slides: migrate code examples to kotlin
- sent updated agenda to kkon for website
- add BootstrapTest
- use flyway instead of DIY-schema creation
- more tests?:
    - check out java testing guide: what else can we test that require special assertions.
    - POST resource: location header
    - add a Scheduler - maybe it will email
    - more complexity required? rename applicant to person and introduce recruiter and hiringManager as parts of the application
