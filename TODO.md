# TODOs

- KotlinTest
    - create some slides (esp for pro and cons)
    - google "unclear" notes
- highlight "KotlinTest, Table-Driven Testing, Property-Based Testing" in slides.
- testing coroutines?
- create branches:
    - master (complete solution) 
    - 1-mock-based-unit-tests
    - 2-integration-tests
    - 3-kotlintest
    - -> document in README
- idea: insert some mistakes in the production code. attendees should find errors by writing tests.
- pass info to attendees. make github repo public.
- create slides 
    - integration test slides: migrate code examples to kotlin
- sent updated agenda to kkon for website
    - KotlinTest, Table-Driven Testing, Property-Based Testing
- add BootstrapTest
- use flyway instead of DIY-schema creation
- more tests?:
    - check out java testing guide: what else can we test that require special assertions.
    - add a Scheduler - maybe it will email
    - more complexity required? rename applicant to person and introduce recruiter and hiringManager as parts of the application
